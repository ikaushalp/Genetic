# Genetic (Hospital Management System)

*Genetic is a Jekyll theme for Netlify CMS. You
can [preview the theme to see what it looks like](https://github.com/mrkaushal/HMS), or
even [use it today](#installation-and-usage).*

## Project philosophy

[Genetic](https://github.com/mrkaushal/HMS) is intended to make it quick and easy
for [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) users to create their first (of 1000s) website. The theme should meet the vast
majority of users' needs out of the box, erring on the side of simplicity rather than flexibility, and provide users the
opportunity to opt-in to additional complexity if they have specific needs or wish to further customize their
experience (such as adding custom CSS or modifying the default layout). It should also look great, but that goes without
saying.

## Installation and Usage

To know how to install the theme and how to use, please refer to
our [documentation](https://github.com/mrkaushal/HMS).

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/mrkaushal/HMS/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
