# GENETIC (Hospital Management System)

This is a web application that helps manage the information related to health care. This web application, as “The Hospital Management System”, 
will be used to give the patient and doctor an innovative way to provide access to features such as ‘Online Appointment’, ’Employee Attendance’, etc. 
Django and Python will be used to develop User interface and backend of this system and MySQL will be used to store the data. In future, system will be enhanced 
to develop a health tracking through mobile application, Billing, Pathology and Investigation Report.
